Assessment for Dev10
The main code for the project is in the file 'index.py'. The files 'vampires.txt', 'candy.txt', and 'ghost.txt' are all supporting text files which are read into the code itself.
For the plan, see the text file, plan.txt. It contains the pseudo-code and thinking I did before attempting to write the application.
